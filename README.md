# PyPacket

A simple console logger to receive APRS packets via rtl_fm (RTL-SDR) and multimon-ng. This project serves as an open source expirimental tool for research into the RF spectrum and APRS. Additionally, it's a means for me to get back into python, learning code style, formatting and conventions.

## Requirements

Requires the following to be installed and configured on your system. At this time, you are on your own with regards to dependency setup. There are significant pieces of this which are hard coded and have no configurability options. See the Future Plans section for more info.

* Python v2.x
* rtl_fm
* multimon-ng
* An RTL-SDR compatible device

## Future Plans

* Simple TCP server (for use in Xastir etc.).
* Command line configuration options for frequency, gain, etc.
* Better documentation.
* Performance optimization.
